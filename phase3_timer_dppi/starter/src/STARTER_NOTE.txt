PHASE 3 STARTER TEMPLATE

This is an advanced phase. The starter template includes:
- Basic project structure
- Necessary includes and configuration files

Key implementation tasks:
1. Configure TIMER22 for periodic interrupts (500 Hz)
2. Set up DPPI channel to connect TIMER to SAADC
3. Configure nrfx SAADC for hardware-triggered sampling
4. Handle SAADC completion events

Refer to the solution for complete implementation.
Students should attempt Phases 0-2 before tackling this phase.
